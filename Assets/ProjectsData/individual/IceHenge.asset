  Title: ICE-HENGE
  PreviewDescription: unity shader demo
  Description: 'Ice-henge is a project developed in Unity3D to showcase custom shaders
    that were created with Unity''s Shader Graphs.


    The project was made as
    a gallery of different shading techniques which include: light refraction, parallax
    effect, environmental fog and texture transformations.


    The scene represents
    a monument, constructed out of ice, that is located in the middle of a frozen
    lake. Above the icy formations, there is a whirling cloud of frost which is the
    source of the freezing weather. A snow particle effect and snowy terrain have
    been added to enhance the scene.
