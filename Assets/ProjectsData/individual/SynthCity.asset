  Title: SYNTHCITY
  PreviewDescription: story driven RPG demo
  Description: "Synthcity is an isometric, story-driven action RPG developed in Unity
    for PC. It served as my dissertation project for the BSc Computer Games Programming
    course at Kingston University.\r\nThe goal was to create a playable demo showcasing
    the game\u2019s core mechanics and systems. Synthcity draws inspiration from
    titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Divinity: Original Sin 2, and Fallout. \n\nThe demo
    features a narrative intro and a full playable level where the player can: Complete
    quests with a World of Warcraft\u2013style quest tracker; Engage in dialogue
    with NPCs through a click-through dialog system; Buy, sell, and loot items, with
    equipment that modifies player stats; Use melee or ranged weapons, each with
    unique abilities; Unlock and use character abilities that enhance gameplay.\r\n\r\nThe
    game\u2019s world is set in a dystopian future where genetic modification and
    body augmentation have become mainstream. Through the story, the player unravels
    a mystery involving a new form of synthetic DNA that threatens to destabilize
    society.\r\n"
