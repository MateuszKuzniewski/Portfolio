  Title: GAME ENGINE
  PreviewDescription: unity inspired c++ game engine
  Description: "This project was my attempt at learning how game engines work.\n\nI
    am using OpenGL for the rendering, ReactPhysics3D for the physics system and
    ImGui for the interface layer. \n\nThe engine supports parsing .obj files, creating
    game objects, adding and retrieving components (albeit not from the interface
    level yet) and modifying properties of transforms and colliders at runtime. The
    lighting is implemented with a Phong shading model. There is a simple, CPU side
    particle system as well.\n\nThis was a fun little project and helped me with
    understanding different layers of the architecture that make game engines although
    I still have a long way to go !"
