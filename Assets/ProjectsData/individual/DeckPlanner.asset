  Title: DECK PLANNER
  PreviewDescription: interactive design software built with Unity3D
  Description: "Deck Planner is a 3D design tool for planning outdoor spaces. It
    lets users design custom decks, choose materials, add features, and generate
    a detailed report for contractors. I worked as part of a small four-person team
    responsible for maintaining and improving the application\u2019s front end. My
    key contributions included:\n\n- Refactored large sections of legacy code to
    improve readability, maintainability, and alignment with modern standards.\n\n-
    Broke down monolithic classes into smaller, modular components while preserving
    existing functionality.\n\n- Rewrote parts of the codebase to better follow the
    MVC architecture.\n\n- Integrated new products and features based on client requirements.\n\n-
    Improved performance by implementing a new data loading and\ncaching system."
