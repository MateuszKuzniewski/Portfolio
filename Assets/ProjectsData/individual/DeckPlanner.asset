  Title: DECK PLANNER
  PreviewDescription: interactive design software built with Unity3D
  Description: "- Implemented a runtime conversion system to switch between imperial
    and metric units based on the localised application version.\n\n- Expanded entity
    functionality by enabling dynamic creation and deletion at runtime, and connecting
    them to corresponding UI elements.\n \n- Built and deployed customized versions
    of the application tailored for specific regions such as Europe and Australia.\n\n-
    Integrated new products into the application based on the requirements from the
    client.\n\n- Worked on major code refactoring efforts, updating legacy code to
    meet modern development standards. \n\n- Modularized the codebase by breaking
    down tightly coupled logic into smaller, more manageable model-view-controller
    submodules, making the code easier to maintain and extend."
