  Title: BURN-UP
  PreviewDescription: fire propagation mechanic demo
  Description: 'This is a demo of a mechanic that I made for a game my friends were
    working on.


    The scene represents a collection of objects that catch fire
    and burn out when a nearby object is ablaze. This was to simulate how fire propagates
    when very flammable items are involved.'
